<p>This chair prototype is my proposal for a school project where we were supposed to design a cardboard chair with a good structure using as less material as possible. Since it's an on a budget thing, I managed to bring the production cost to 15€ although it could be even 0€ if using reused cardboard. The design is 100% cardboard, no glue required, can vary from holding 100 kg (highest weight tested) to children sized ones, DIY project. Also the design is very ergonomic so that you can relax in various positions while reading or having other sitting activities.</p>","<h3>iAmestec / iStir</h3>\
<p>I made this prototype as a response at a school project based on recycled/repurposed design in my first year of my bachelor degree. It is a stirring object for when you are boiling fruit to make a gem, for example, and the consistent bubbles jump out and burn you or similar situations. It is build from a broken plastic mixing machine, a plastic cup, some metal frame and a metal net.</p>","<h3>The unreliable chair - 2014, Ro, UVT, AD</h3>\
<p>Impossible design/ useless design concept brought up for another school theme. It looks like a normal chair at first sight but the thing is that it's a chair that you shouldn't trust leaning your back on. The back-rest is designed as a bar door so that when you want to rest on it, it will just open and let you fall</p>","<h3>Designer's working desk - 2013, Ro, UVT, AD</h3>\
<p>A mini model I made for school. The model is scale reduced so that you can see the actual proportions. it's ergonomically designed to satisfy a designer's needs when desk working in normal and optimum positions.</p>","<h3>Bionic Study - 2012, Ro, UVT, AD</h3>\
<p>A work i enjoyed very much in the Product Design class where we had to chose any bionic, natural shape we each want, study it as it is, simplify it, create a geometry interpretation and than make a 3D model. For my crab study model i used thin carton sticked with paper glue.</p>","<h3>Kitchen Tools Set - 2012, Ro, UVT, AD</h3>\
<p>This is a set of six necessary kitchen tools with a multifunctional, modular stand. The design is playful and at the same geometric and minimalistic so that you can easily integrate anywhere. Because of it's color palette it could suite almost any kitchen. Cheap, recycled materials could be used for producing this set. A combination of heat resistant plastic for the body, rubber for the grip pins on each one, also rubber for the pins.</p>","<h3>Moka Pot/ European Espresso Coffee Maker - 2012, Ro, UVT, AD</h3>\
<p>A concept i realized in my first year of university. The object was created as a stylish product which combines two materials in a minimalistic elegant design. The upper part, made out of transparent glass let's you visually enjoy half of the beautiful process of coffee making and also allows you to serve with at table due to it's sealing system when unscrewed.</p>"],"image":"img/btn0.png"},

<p>I designed this ledCloud concept for a stage design I created with the event planning agency l a u n m o m e n t d a t. The event took place on Halloween and it was called, as translated, At Some Point - the other way around/upside down. As so, to respect the theme, we brought the outside inside. The composing elements of a cloud are as following 1. A well made steel wire 3D cloud structure 2. A perfectly tight wrap around with elastic plastic foil 3. A uniform cover up in synthetic cotton puffs 4. A led series placed inside of the cloud with a 3V battery attached<p>","<p>You can watch the after movie of the event here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-wsNUZDaB4</p>","<p>You can watch the after movie of the event here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-wsNUZDaB4</p>","<p>You can watch the after movie of the event here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-wsNUZDaB4</p>","<h3>MiniMe - 2014, Pt, IPB, AD</h3>\
<p>MiniMe was born during my Erasmus mobility in Portugal for the sculpture class, the theme being poses in movement, we were requested to chose a pose, take pictures of ourselves in this position from all angles, reduce to half of the original scale and build a sculpture by adding many layers of bandage and plaster on a metallic stickman. i chose a pose from a contemporary dancing scene.</p>","<h3>Carved table - 2014, Ro, Atelier Cafe Timisoara</h3>\
<p>This piece was made especially for Atelier Cafe, a place which constantly exhibits local artists. The design is made as so as you can see it 'properly' from any side you look upon it. It is a concentric circular construction applied to an organic figurative composition representing a mini-world. I carved the model in wood with a hand machine.</p>","<h3>Halloween Che Guevara Pumpkin - 2013</h3>\
<p>Hand carved into pumkin for el'Che pub&club Halloween Party</p>","<h3>Pet Portraits - 2012 -present, Ro </h3>\
<p>At the beginning i started by drawing my dog, than, as it turned out good, I started to make presents for my pet loving family and friends . Nowadays I am earning some money by doing this from time to time on the demand of the owner. I used pencil on paper looking at a picture.</p>","<h3>Studies</h3>\
<p>I really like pencil drawing and understanding shapes and movement and get inspiration out of nature and its beautiful constructions.</p>","<h3>Studies</h3>\
